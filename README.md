# ML_Project_KNN_MLP_SVM_ADB
K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Nets, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machines

The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using various machine-learning algorithms. We explore different supervised learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and AdaBoost to find the most accurate model for digit recognition.

üìö Concepts Explained

üîç 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric classification algorithm. It classifies a data point based on the majority label of its K nearest neighbors in feature space.

Advantages: Simple and effective for small datasets.
Disadvantages: Sensitive to the choice of K and computationally expensive for large datasets.

ü§ñ 2. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected neurons that learn to represent complex patterns in data.

Structure: Input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
Training: Uses backpropagation and optimization techniques like gradient descent.
Applications: Widely used in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language processing.

‚ö° 3. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)
AdaBoost is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak classifiers (like decision trees) to create a strong classifier. It assigns higher weights to misclassified instances and focuses on them in subsequent iterations.

Advantages: Improves accuracy compared to individual weak classifiers.
Disadvantages: Sensitive to noise and outliers.

üìè 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning models that find the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in feature space.

Linear SVM: Works well for linearly separable data.
Kernel SVM: Extends SVM to handle non-linear data using kernels like the RBF kernel.
Advantages: Effective for high-dimensional data.
Disadvantages: Computationally expensive for large datasets.
